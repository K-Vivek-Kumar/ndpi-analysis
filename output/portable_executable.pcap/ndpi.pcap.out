* In this demo we have implemented only some basic features

Risk stats [found 2 (100.0 %) flows with risks]:
	Binary App Transfer                          2 [50.0 %]
	Susp Entropy                                 2 [50.0 %]

	NOTE: as one flow can have multiple risks set, the sum of the
	      last column can exceed the number of flows with risks.
