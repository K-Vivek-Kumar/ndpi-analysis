Risk stats [found 2 (66.7 %) flows with risks]:
	Known Proto on Non Std Port                  1 [25.0 %]
	Missing SNI TLS Extn                         1 [25.0 %]
	Unidirectional Traffic                       1 [25.0 %]
	ALPN/SNI Mismatch                            1 [25.0 %]

	NOTE: as one flow can have multiple risks set, the sum of the
	      last column can exceed the number of flows with risks.
