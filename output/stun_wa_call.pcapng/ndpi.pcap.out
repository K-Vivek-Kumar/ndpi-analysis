Risk stats [found 3 (23.1 %) flows with risks]:
	Known Proto on Non Std Port                  2 [40.0 %]
	Susp Entropy                                 1 [20.0 %]
	Unidirectional Traffic                       2 [40.0 %]

	NOTE: as one flow can have multiple risks set, the sum of the
	      last column can exceed the number of flows with risks.
