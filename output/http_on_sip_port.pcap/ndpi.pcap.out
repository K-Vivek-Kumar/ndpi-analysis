Risk stats [found 1 (100.0 %) flows with risks]:
	Known Proto on Non Std Port                  1 [33.3 %]
	HTTP/TLS/QUIC Numeric Hostname/SNI           1 [33.3 %]
	Error Code                                   1 [33.3 %]

	NOTE: as one flow can have multiple risks set, the sum of the
	      last column can exceed the number of flows with risks.
