	Acceptable           packets: 299           bytes: 305728        flows: 24           

Risk stats [found 22 (91.7 %) flows with risks]:
	Known Proto on Non Std Port                 22 [78.6 %]
	Unidirectional Traffic                       6 [21.4 %]

	NOTE: as one flow can have multiple risks set, the sum of the
	      last column can exceed the number of flows with risks.
