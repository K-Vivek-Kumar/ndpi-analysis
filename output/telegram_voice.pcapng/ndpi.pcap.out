Risk stats [found 4 (40.0 %) flows with risks]:
	Known Proto on Non Std Port                  3 [60.0 %]
	Susp Entropy                                 1 [20.0 %]
	Unidirectional Traffic                       1 [20.0 %]

	NOTE: as one flow can have multiple risks set, the sum of the
	      last column can exceed the number of flows with risks.
