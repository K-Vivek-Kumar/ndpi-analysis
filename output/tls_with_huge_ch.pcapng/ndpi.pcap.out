Risk stats [found 1 (100.0 %) flows with risks]:
	Missing SNI TLS Extn                         1 [33.3 %]
	ALPN/SNI Mismatch                            1 [33.3 %]
	Obfuscated Traffic                           1 [33.3 %]

	NOTE: as one flow can have multiple risks set, the sum of the
	      last column can exceed the number of flows with risks.
