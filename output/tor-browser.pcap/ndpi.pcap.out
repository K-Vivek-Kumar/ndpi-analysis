Risk stats [found 6 (66.7 %) flows with risks]:
	TLS (probably) Not Carrying HTTPS            5 [33.3 %]
	Susp DGA Domain name                         3 [20.0 %]
	Unsafe Protocol                              5 [33.3 %]
	Susp Entropy                                 1 [ 6.7 %]
	Unidirectional Traffic                       1 [ 6.7 %]

	NOTE: as one flow can have multiple risks set, the sum of the
	      last column can exceed the number of flows with risks.
