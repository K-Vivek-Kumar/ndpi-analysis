Risk stats [found 8 (80.0 %) flows with risks]:
	Unsafe Protocol                              2 [12.5 %]
	Unidirectional Traffic                       8 [50.0 %]
	TCP Connection Issues                        6 [37.5 %]

	NOTE: as one flow can have multiple risks set, the sum of the
	      last column can exceed the number of flows with risks.
