Risk stats [found 3 (100.0 %) flows with risks]:
	Susp DGA Domain name                         3 [33.3 %]
	Susp DNS Traffic                             3 [33.3 %]
	Risky Domain Name                            3 [33.3 %]

	NOTE: as one flow can have multiple risks set, the sum of the
	      last column can exceed the number of flows with risks.
