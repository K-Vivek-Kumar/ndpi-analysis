Protocol statistics:

Risk stats [found 6 (100.0 %) flows with risks]:
	Unsafe Protocol                              6 [85.7 %]
	Clear-Text Credentials                       1 [14.3 %]

	NOTE: as one flow can have multiple risks set, the sum of the
	      last column can exceed the number of flows with risks.
