Risk stats [found 32 (52.5 %) flows with risks]:
	HTTP/TLS/QUIC Numeric Hostname/SNI          18 [36.0 %]
	TLS (probably) Not Carrying HTTPS           12 [24.0 %]
	HTTP Susp Content                            1 [ 2.0 %]
	Unidirectional Traffic                       1 [ 2.0 %]
	Binary File/Data Transfer (Attempt)         18 [36.0 %]

	NOTE: as one flow can have multiple risks set, the sum of the
	      last column can exceed the number of flows with risks.
