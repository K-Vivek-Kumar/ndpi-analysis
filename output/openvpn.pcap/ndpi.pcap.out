Risk stats [found 8 (80.0 %) flows with risks]:
	Known Proto on Non Std Port                  8 [72.7 %]
	Susp Entropy                                 1 [ 9.1 %]
	Unidirectional Traffic                       2 [18.2 %]

	NOTE: as one flow can have multiple risks set, the sum of the
	      last column can exceed the number of flows with risks.
