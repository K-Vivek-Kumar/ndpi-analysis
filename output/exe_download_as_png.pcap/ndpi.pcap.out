Risk stats [found 1 (100.0 %) flows with risks]:
	Binary App Transfer                          1 [33.3 %]
	HTTP/TLS/QUIC Numeric Hostname/SNI           1 [33.3 %]
	HTTP Obsolete Server                         1 [33.3 %]

	NOTE: as one flow can have multiple risks set, the sum of the
	      last column can exceed the number of flows with risks.
