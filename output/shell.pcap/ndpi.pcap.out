Risk stats [found 4 (100.0 %) flows with risks]:
	Susp Entropy                                 2 [25.0 %]
	Possible Exploit Attempt                     4 [50.0 %]
	Unidirectional Traffic                       2 [25.0 %]

	NOTE: as one flow can have multiple risks set, the sum of the
	      last column can exceed the number of flows with risks.
