Protocol statistics:
	Unsafe               packets: 18            bytes: 1700          flows: 1            

Risk stats [found 1 (100.0 %) flows with risks]:
	Unsafe Protocol                              1 [50.0 %]
	Clear-Text Credentials                       1 [50.0 %]

	NOTE: as one flow can have multiple risks set, the sum of the
	      last column can exceed the number of flows with risks.
