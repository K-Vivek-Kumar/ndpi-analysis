Risk stats [found 3 (100.0 %) flows with risks]:
	Missing SNI TLS Extn                         3 [25.0 %]
	TLS Susp Extn                                3 [25.0 %]
	Unidirectional Traffic                       3 [25.0 %]
	ALPN/SNI Mismatch                            3 [25.0 %]

	NOTE: as one flow can have multiple risks set, the sum of the
	      last column can exceed the number of flows with risks.
