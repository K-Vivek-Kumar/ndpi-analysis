Risk stats [found 3 (100.0 %) flows with risks]:
	Known Proto on Non Std Port                  1 [25.0 %]
	SSH Obsolete Cli Vers/Cipher                 1 [25.0 %]
	SSH Obsolete Ser Vers/Cipher                 1 [25.0 %]
	Unidirectional Traffic                       1 [25.0 %]

	NOTE: as one flow can have multiple risks set, the sum of the
	      last column can exceed the number of flows with risks.
