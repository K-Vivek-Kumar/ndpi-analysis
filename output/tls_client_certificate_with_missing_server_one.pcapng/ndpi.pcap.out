Risk stats [found 2 (100.0 %) flows with risks]:
	Known Proto on Non Std Port                  1 [16.7 %]
	TLS (probably) Not Carrying HTTPS            1 [16.7 %]
	Missing SNI TLS Extn                         2 [33.3 %]
	Desktop/File Sharing                         1 [16.7 %]
	Uncommon TLS ALPN                            1 [16.7 %]

	NOTE: as one flow can have multiple risks set, the sum of the
	      last column can exceed the number of flows with risks.
