* NOTE: This is demo app to show *some* nDPI features.
* In this demo we have implemented only some basic features

Risk stats [found 3 (30.0 %) flows with risks]:
	Known Proto on Non Std Port                  1 [33.3 %]
	Minor Issues                                 2 [66.7 %]

	NOTE: as one flow can have multiple risks set, the sum of the
	      last column can exceed the number of flows with risks.
