* In this demo we have implemented only some basic features

Risk stats [found 4 (66.7 %) flows with risks]:
	Binary App Transfer                          2 [20.0 %]
	Self-signed Cert                             1 [10.0 %]
	HTTP Susp User-Agent                         1 [10.0 %]

	Binary File/Data Transfer (Attempt)          2 [20.0 %]

	NOTE: as one flow can have multiple risks set, the sum of the
	      last column can exceed the number of flows with risks.
