Risk stats [found 12 (60.0 %) flows with risks]:
	Known Proto on Non Std Port                  4 [15.4 %]
	Self-signed Cert                             2 [ 7.7 %]
	Obsolete TLS (v1.1 or older)                 3 [11.5 %]

	Probing Attempt                              3 [11.5 %]

	NOTE: as one flow can have multiple risks set, the sum of the
	      last column can exceed the number of flows with risks.
