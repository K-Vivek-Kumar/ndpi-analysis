Risk stats [found 7 (100.0 %) flows with risks]:
	Desktop/File Sharing                         1 [ 6.7 %]
	TCP Connection Issues                        7 [46.7 %]
	Probing Attempt                              7 [46.7 %]

	NOTE: as one flow can have multiple risks set, the sum of the
	      last column can exceed the number of flows with risks.
