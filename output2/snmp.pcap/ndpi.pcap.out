	Acceptable           packets: 72            bytes: 14435         flows: 17           

Risk stats [found 7 (41.2 %) flows with risks]:
	Error Code                                   2 [25.0 %]
	Unidirectional Traffic                       6 [75.0 %]

	NOTE: as one flow can have multiple risks set, the sum of the
	      last column can exceed the number of flows with risks.
