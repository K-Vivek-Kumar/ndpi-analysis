Risk stats [found 1 (100.0 %) flows with risks]:
	Weak TLS Cipher                              1 [25.0 %]
	TLS (probably) Not Carrying HTTPS            1 [25.0 %]
	Unsafe Protocol                              1 [25.0 %]
	Missing SNI TLS Extn                         1 [25.0 %]

	NOTE: as one flow can have multiple risks set, the sum of the
	      last column can exceed the number of flows with risks.
