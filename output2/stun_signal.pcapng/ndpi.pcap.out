Risk stats [found 17 (73.9 %) flows with risks]:
	Known Proto on Non Std Port                 15 [65.2 %]
	Susp Entropy                                 2 [ 8.7 %]
	Unidirectional Traffic                       6 [26.1 %]

	NOTE: as one flow can have multiple risks set, the sum of the
	      last column can exceed the number of flows with risks.
