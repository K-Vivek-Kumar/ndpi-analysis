Risk stats [found 8 (38.1 %) flows with risks]:
	Large DNS Packet (512+ bytes)                7 [46.7 %]
	Fragmented DNS Message                       7 [46.7 %]
	Error Code                                   1 [ 6.7 %]

	NOTE: as one flow can have multiple risks set, the sum of the
	      last column can exceed the number of flows with risks.
