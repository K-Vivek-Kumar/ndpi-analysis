Protocol statistics:
	Fun                  packets: 32            bytes: 13467         flows: 2            

Risk stats [found 1 (50.0 %) flows with risks]:
	Weak TLS Cipher                              1 [33.3 %]
	TLS (probably) Not Carrying HTTPS            1 [33.3 %]
	TLS Cert Validity Too Long                   1 [33.3 %]

	NOTE: as one flow can have multiple risks set, the sum of the
	      last column can exceed the number of flows with risks.
