Risk stats [found 7 (100.0 %) flows with risks]:
	HTTP/TLS/QUIC Numeric Hostname/SNI           1 [14.3 %]
	Susp Entropy                                 5 [71.4 %]
	Unidirectional Traffic                       1 [14.3 %]

	NOTE: as one flow can have multiple risks set, the sum of the
	      last column can exceed the number of flows with risks.
