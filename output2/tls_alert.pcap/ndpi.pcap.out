Risk stats [found 2 (100.0 %) flows with risks]:
	Obsolete TLS (v1.1 or older)                 1 [33.3 %]
	TLS Fatal Alert                              1 [33.3 %]
	Unidirectional Traffic                       1 [33.3 %]

	NOTE: as one flow can have multiple risks set, the sum of the
	      last column can exceed the number of flows with risks.
