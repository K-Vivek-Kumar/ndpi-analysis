Risk stats [found 2 (100.0 %) flows with risks]:
	Weak TLS Cipher                              1 [16.7 %]
	TLS (probably) Not Carrying HTTPS            2 [33.3 %]
	Missing SNI TLS Extn                         2 [33.3 %]
	TLS Cert About To Expire                     1 [16.7 %]

	NOTE: as one flow can have multiple risks set, the sum of the
	      last column can exceed the number of flows with risks.
