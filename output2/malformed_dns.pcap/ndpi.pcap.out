Risk stats [found 1 (100.0 %) flows with risks]:
	Malformed Packet                             1 [33.3 %]
	Large DNS Packet (512+ bytes)                1 [33.3 %]
	Minor Issues                                 1 [33.3 %]

	NOTE: as one flow can have multiple risks set, the sum of the
	      last column can exceed the number of flows with risks.
