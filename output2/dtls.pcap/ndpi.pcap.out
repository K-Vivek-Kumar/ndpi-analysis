Risk stats [found 2 (66.7 %) flows with risks]:
	TLS (probably) Not Carrying HTTPS            2 [40.0 %]
	Missing SNI TLS Extn                         2 [40.0 %]
	Unidirectional Traffic                       1 [20.0 %]

	NOTE: as one flow can have multiple risks set, the sum of the
	      last column can exceed the number of flows with risks.
