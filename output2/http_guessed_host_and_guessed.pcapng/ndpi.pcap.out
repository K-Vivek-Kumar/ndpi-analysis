Detected protocols:

Protocol statistics:

Risk stats [found 1 (100.0 %) flows with risks]:
	Unsafe Protocol                              1 [20.0 %]
	Susp Entropy                                 1 [20.0 %]
	Unidirectional Traffic                       1 [20.0 %]
	TCP Connection Issues                        1 [20.0 %]
	Probing Attempt                              1 [20.0 %]

	NOTE: as one flow can have multiple risks set, the sum of the
	      last column can exceed the number of flows with risks.
