Risk stats [found 67 (87.0 %) flows with risks]:
	Known Proto on Non Std Port                 42 [46.7 %]
	Susp Entropy                                 6 [ 6.7 %]
	Unidirectional Traffic                      42 [46.7 %]

	NOTE: as one flow can have multiple risks set, the sum of the
	      last column can exceed the number of flows with risks.
