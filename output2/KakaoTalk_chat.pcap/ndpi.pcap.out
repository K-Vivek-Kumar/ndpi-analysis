Risk stats [found 13 (34.2 %) flows with risks]:
	Known Proto on Non Std Port                  3 [15.8 %]
	Obsolete TLS (v1.1 or older)                 5 [26.3 %]
	Weak TLS Cipher                              1 [ 5.3 %]
	TLS (probably) Not Carrying HTTPS            3 [15.8 %]
	Unidirectional Traffic                       5 [26.3 %]
	TCP Connection Issues                        1 [ 5.3 %]
	Probing Attempt                              1 [ 5.3 %]

	NOTE: as one flow can have multiple risks set, the sum of the
	      last column can exceed the number of flows with risks.
