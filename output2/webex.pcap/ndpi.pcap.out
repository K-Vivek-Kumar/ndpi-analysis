Risk stats [found 53 (93.0 %) flows with risks]:
	Obsolete TLS (v1.1 or older)                44 [49.4 %]
	Weak TLS Cipher                             35 [39.3 %]
	TLS (probably) Not Carrying HTTPS            5 [ 5.6 %]
	Unidirectional Traffic                       1 [ 1.1 %]
	HTTP Obsolete Server                         2 [ 2.2 %]
	TCP Connection Issues                        1 [ 1.1 %]
	Probing Attempt                              1 [ 1.1 %]

	NOTE: as one flow can have multiple risks set, the sum of the
	      last column can exceed the number of flows with risks.
