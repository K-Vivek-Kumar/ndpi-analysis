Risk stats [found 4 (50.0 %) flows with risks]:
	Missing SNI TLS Extn                         4 [33.3 %]
	TLS Susp Extn                                4 [33.3 %]
	ALPN/SNI Mismatch                            4 [33.3 %]

	NOTE: as one flow can have multiple risks set, the sum of the
	      last column can exceed the number of flows with risks.
