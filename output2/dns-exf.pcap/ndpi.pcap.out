Risk stats [found 1 (100.0 %) flows with risks]:
	Susp DNS Traffic                             1 [25.0 %]
	Susp Entropy                                 1 [25.0 %]
	Non-Printable/Invalid Chars Detected         1 [25.0 %]
	Minor Issues                                 1 [25.0 %]

	NOTE: as one flow can have multiple risks set, the sum of the
	      last column can exceed the number of flows with risks.
