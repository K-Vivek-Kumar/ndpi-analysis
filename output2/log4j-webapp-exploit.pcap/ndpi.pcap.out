Risk stats [found 6 (85.7 %) flows with risks]:
	Binary App Transfer                          2 [14.3 %]
	Known Proto on Non Std Port                  3 [21.4 %]
	HTTP/TLS/QUIC Numeric Hostname/SNI           3 [21.4 %]

	NOTE: as one flow can have multiple risks set, the sum of the
	      last column can exceed the number of flows with risks.
