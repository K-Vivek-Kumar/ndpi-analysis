	Acceptable           packets: 43            bytes: 10358         flows: 2            

Risk stats [found 2 (100.0 %) flows with risks]:
	Known Proto on Non Std Port                  2 [50.0 %]
	Unidirectional Traffic                       2 [50.0 %]

	NOTE: as one flow can have multiple risks set, the sum of the
	      last column can exceed the number of flows with risks.
