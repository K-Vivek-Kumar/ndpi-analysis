Risk stats [found 1 (100.0 %) flows with risks]:
	Binary App Transfer                          1 [20.0 %]
	HTTP Susp User-Agent                         1 [20.0 %]

	Binary File/Data Transfer (Attempt)          1 [20.0 %]

	NOTE: as one flow can have multiple risks set, the sum of the
	      last column can exceed the number of flows with risks.
